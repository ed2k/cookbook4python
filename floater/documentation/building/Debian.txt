BUILDING DEBIAN PACKAGES

This file describes how to build Floater's Debian packages.


1. Run ./build/mkdist to make a new source distribution.

2. Rename the resulting source file to the Debian naming
   convention for source tarballs, something like:
   
     floater_1.4.15.orig.tar.gz

3. Move this file to an empty working directory, and untar it.
   Change directory (cd) to the resulting directory.

4. Edit debian/control and delete the section about the floater-server
   package.  The floater-server package is not distributed through
   Debian, and is only useful for people wanting to run their own
   server.

5. Run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot".
