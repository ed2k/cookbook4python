  o  Some bug fixes and other minor improvements.

Version 1.2b2 released for Macintosh on October 25, 1999:

  o  Better handling of fonts
  o  Better Macintosh support
  o  Some bug fixes

Version 1.2b1 released for Unix and Microsoft Windows on September 14, 1999:

  o  Faster server (on better hardware).
  o  New installer for Microsoft Windows.
  o  Very long table names now work correctly.
  o  Fixed minor bug in "beep at my turn" option.
  o  Communications are more fault-tolerant.

Version 1.1.3 released January 30, 1998:

  o  Added default bids (pass) and plays (follow small).  If you press the
     return key on an empty talk line or command line, the appropriate
     default is inserted as if you had typed it.  You then may press return
     again to perform the default action.
  o  New "Hide Command Line" option (GUI only).
  o  More commands accessable from menus (GUI).
  o  More font choices.
  o  If a test connection from the server to your machine fails then
     you are not allowed to host a table.  This is to prevent people behind
     firewalls from trying to host a table---previously those people
     could host a table, causing problems both for those trying to join
     the table and, sometimes, other people trying to host.
  o  Login names are now case-insensitive.
  o  Created a log of changes (available from the help menu in the GUI
     and on the web page).

  o  Clarified a few things
  o  No longer crashes when user separates then destroys the talk window
  o  Results at rubber bridge were always scored correctly, but
      a bug that sometimes would report the wrong declarer is now fixed
  o  Obscure bug involving kibbitzers (never players) sometimes being shown
      the declarer's hand instead of the dummy's hand is now fixed
  o  Improved configure script for Unix
  o  Fixed README file to indicate that you must have Tcl/Tk 8.0
      (previous README file incorrectly stated that Tcl 7.6 was OK)
