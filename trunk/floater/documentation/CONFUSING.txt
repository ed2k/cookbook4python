This file is intended to list some of the more confusing aspects of
using Floater.

1. Floater relies on self-alerts.  If playing formally, you are
expected to explain your bidding and carding agreements as carefully
as you would at a tournament.  In any case, you alert by using the
commands `alert,' `redalert' and `explain.'   You should alert
at the same time or before you take an alertable action.  There are no
fixed rules as to what agreements are alertable---use your judgment
and do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

The easy way to alert an action is to type "!" (or "!!" for redalert)
on the same line as the command to perform that action---and
optionally put an explanation at the end.  For example, you could type
"2D!weak two in either major" to bid and alert your own bid
simultaneously.  See also the help on `alert,' `redalert' and
`explain.'

If you are using the graphical user interface, you may click on the
"Alert" or "Redalert" checkboxes BEFORE clicking on the call you wish
to make.  For example, clicking on "1C" when the "Alert" checkbox is
highlighted will have the same effect as typing "1C!" on the keyboard.

Everyone at the table except partner sees your alerts.
