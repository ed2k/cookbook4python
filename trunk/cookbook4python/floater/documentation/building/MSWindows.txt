Building Floater for MSWindows

This file describes cross-compiling the client for MSWindows using a
Unix machine.


0. Install mingw .  Debian folks can do "apt-get install mingw" .

1. You need three libraries: tcl, tk, and pdcurses.
   (XXX Someone should fill in the details of getting these libraries.)

2. You need jam.  Debian folks can "apt-get install jam" .


3. In Floater, run configure with the following options:
    --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu      # or whatever config.guess says
                                   # about your platform 
    --host=i586-mingw32msvc
    --with-tcl-include=  <path to tcl includes>
    --with-tk-include=   <path to tk includes>
    --with-tcl-lib= <path to directory holding the Tcl dll>
    --with-tk-lib=  <path to directory holding the Tk dll>
    --with-curses=  <path to pdcurses>

A typical full configure command is:

    ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-tcl-include=/home/lex/floater/win32-libs/tcltk/tcl8.4.5/generic --with-tk-include=/home/lex/floater/win32-libs/tcltk/tk8.4.5 --with-tcl-lib=/home/lex/floater/win32-libs/tcltk/tcl8.4.5/win/bld2 --with-tk-lib=/home/lex/floater/win32-libs/tcltk/tk8.4.5/win/bld2 --with-curses=/home/lex/floater/win32-libs/pdcurses


4. Run "jam".  You should end up with files named "floater" and
   "floatert".


5. Prepare a distribution directory as follows:

   c:/Floater-tmp/
       Floater/
           Floater.exe       # renamed from "floater"
           Floatert.exe      # renamed from "floatert"
           tcl8.4.dll
           tk8.4.dll         # and add any other DLL'S
                             # that Tcl/Tk generated
           curses.dll        # if pdcurses was dynamically linked
       lib/
           tcl8.4/
               (init.tcl, etc., for tcl)
           tk8.4/
               (tk.tcl, etc., for tk)
       Copyright             # copied from win32/copyright
       floater.iss           # copied from win32/copyright

6. Edit the version number of Floater in floater.iss.

7. Run Inno Setup on floater.iss.  The output will be saved
   as C:\Floater-tmp\Output\Setup.exe  .
