COMPILING FLOATER

To compile Floater on Mac OS/X, you need Jam and the Tcl/Tk libraries.
Once these are available:

  0. Open a terminal and cd to the root of the CVS repository.

  1. Edit mac/Jamsettings.macosx and set FRAMEWORK_DIR.

  2. Edit mac/app-contents/Contents/Info.plist and update the
     version string.

  3. Execute ./build/build-macosx


You will end up with a file named floater-nnnn-macosx.zip, where nnnn
is the current version number of Floater.


COMPILING TCL/TK

You can compile your own Tcl and Tk frameworks from the standard
source distributions on tcl.sourceforge.net.

   1. Untar tcl and tk in directories beside each other.

   2. (cd tcl/macosx; make)

   3. (cd tk/macosx; make)

   4. cp -r build/tcl/Tcl.framework  "wherever you want"

   5. cp -r build/tcl/Tk.framework  "wherever you want"
 

If you get an error about /usr/bin/pbxbuild not existing, then hack
the two makefiles to use "/usr/bin/xcodebuild" instead of
"/usr/bin/pbxbuild".



RATIONALE

There are other ways to build on OS/X that would have made sense.

An autoconf-based build setup is not used on Mac OS/X for a few reasons.

First, it would greatly complicate the configure.in script, because
Mac OS/X wants to use frameworks.  Frameworks require their own set of
flags and directory layouts, and thus require specially handling
throughout the autoconf file.  If autoconf ever does support frameworks
natively, then using autoconf will become more tempting.

Second, there is no auto-configuration to do.  It's OS/X, which is
a fixed target.

Third, only one developer is actively working on Floater on OS/X right
now.  If that ever changes, then making things scriptier and generally
nicer to work with could well be reconsidered.


XCode would be another option.  However, XCode is difficult to use
remotely, which means that preparing every distribution would require
a visit to an OS/X machine to compile the stuff.


The option settled on is to maintain a separate Jamsettings file and
build script.  This approach is pretty simple in practice.
