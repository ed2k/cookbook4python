BUILDING FLOATER ON UNIX

This file describes how to build Floater on a Unix machine.



PREREQUISITES

Floater is built using "jam" instead of the more common "make".  If
jam is not already installed on your computer, then grab it from here:
   
   http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html


Floater also requires that you have the development files for Tcl/Tk
8.0 or newer available.  If you do not have these, then you can obtain
them from:

   http://tcl.sourceforge.net



COMPILING

Once you have the prerequisites, run the following commands:

	./configure
	jam

This will result in a binary being created named "floater".  Run and
enjoy!



TROUBLESHOOTING


If the "configure" script is not present, e.g. if you are compiling
directly from the CVS repository, then you first need to run
"autoconf" before running the above commands.

If the build fails, then run "./configure --help" and see if there are
any configuration options that may fix the problem.

If you are out of ideas, then please contact the developers as
described in the README.txt file at the root of the Floater source
tree.
