8. When I host, scoring method defaults to whatever it was at the
previous table.  Furthermore, when I do, say, "score imp," the list of
tables isn't updated immediately.

7. When using the GUI, occasionally I have had the menu bar at the
top disappear and not come back.  This appears to be a Tcl/Tk bug.  If
it happens, iconify Floater and then restore it, and the menu bar
will reappear.

6. The review command sometimes puts your side's actions in parens.
I think it should always put the other guys' actions in parens.

5. Pseudomail works but doesn't correctly report whether it succeeded.
(It always reports success.)

4. The documentation is a work in progress.  For the latest, look at:

3. Curses may be confused about your screen size or terminal attributes.
Putting the following in your .cshrc may do the trick:
    setenv TERM vt100

    set noglob
    eval `tset -s`
    unset noglob

Another possible fix is to try doing:
    eval `resize`

2. Logging in disconnects you from the table.  (This is becuase the other
players would become confused if your name suddenly changed.  But it
can be fixed.)

1. Sometimes after being shunted (when you do the `host' command) you
find that you do not get connected properly to the table tree.  When
this happens, try again a few times.  As a last resort, you may do
`host <tablename>' to try to join the table tree at that location.
