This package holds the Floater server.

To start, stop, or restart the server, use the script in /etc/init.d.
The relevant commands are:

	/etc/init.d/floater-server start
	/etc/init.d/floater-server restart
	/etc/init.d/floater-server stop


By default, the server will run automatically when the system boots.
